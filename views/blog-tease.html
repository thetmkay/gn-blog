It's another summer, so it's time to release another blog. Time to do things, time to write, and time to hack together some CSS, HTML and Javascript. Is there anything substantially different from last summer's iteration? Probably not from the outside. In fact, there might be less - certainly way less than a Tumblr or Wordpress (let's just call this my ode to Apple). Back here there's plenty of changes, and plenty more in the pipeline, which you can follow in <a class="blog-tease-link" href="https://github.com/thetmkay/gn-blog"> the Github Repo</a>. In the meantime, I hope you find something interesting to read below!
